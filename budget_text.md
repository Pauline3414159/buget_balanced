Welcome to the Balanced Money Formula Calculator. This website will give you a sanity check on whether or not your budget is sustainable.

The balanced money formula was created by [Elizabeth Warren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren) and [Amelia Warren Tyagi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Warren_Tyagi)

Check out [how to use]() our calculator.

#Why Balanced Money Formula

The balanced money formula provides a moderate, sustainable approach to finances that is easier to stick to than [a more extreme approach](http://earlyretirementextreme.com/).

The formula is 

- 50 % needs (items you must pay no matter what like housing, groceries, or electricity)
- 30 % wants (items that you want like like takeout, cable tv or netflix, concert tickets, gifts, or charitable contributions)
- 20 % debt repayment OR savings

By keeping your needs, wants, and savings (or debt repayment) in balance, you will be able to enjoy managing your money knowing that you have everything covered. 


#How to Use

1. Enter your monthly take home income
2. The amount of money available for needs, wants, and savings (or debt repayment) is calculated for you. 
3. Add subcategories (like housing) to the appropriate category (needs) with your monthly spending on that item ($1000 in housing payment)
4. If you are over budget for needs, wants, or savings, consider checking out [All Your Worth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/88654.All_Your_Worth) from your public library
