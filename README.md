## Balanced Budget Application

The balanced money formula was created by Elizabeth Warren and Amelia Warren Tyagi and is found in the book [All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/88654.All_Your_Worth). The formula provides a moderate, sustainable approach to finances by keeping your needs, wants, and savings (or debt repayment) in balance.

The Balanced Budget application allows the user to enter their monthly income and spending for different categories and displays how well their budget correlates with the balanced money formula.
